Car Crash - Drunk Edition
=========================

This project is my very first individual project. It's the continuation of a proposed exercise by **Academia de Código** at _Bootcamp #2_ that I was attending. This was made in the third week of classes. Notice that Academia de Código's course was my very first contact with programming.

The initial exercise was in a very very simple graphic library called Lanterna. It displayed a small grid, where each car was a single rectangle.The goal was to make the cars move randomly and make them crash when their trajectories intersected. Cars then could have different speeds. So I created two types of cars, Coupe (faster) and Jazz (slower) in honor of Honda Cars. A collision detector was required to avoid cars going over without crashing. Then, at an afterhours class, I created a real life example to program about drunkness. So I had the idea to cross both ideas. Now cars could be drunk or sober (randomly), and that would affect how many times they choose direction and their speed.

Later on, we were introduced to a stronger, still very simple graphics library called SimpleGraphics. Now the cars could have the shape of pictures and move pixel by pixel. Added a Cop Car that bustes all drunk cars. Finally, added powerUps that are caught when cars go over them. There are Barrels that tunr sober cars into drunk cars. Guronsan (medicin to heal hangovers) to turn drunk cars into sober cars. Speedbuster that increases cars speed. When a cop car catches a barrel, he becomes drunk and instead of busting drunk cars, bustes sober cars.
